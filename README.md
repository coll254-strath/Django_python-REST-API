1. # Install Python #:
 Head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of Python for your operating system. Ensure you check the box to "Add Python to PATH" during installation. Open a terminal or command prompt and verify by running python --version.

2. # Create a Virtual Environment (Optional )#
 A virtual environment isolates project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects. Use python -m venv <environment_name> to create one. Activate it using source <environment_name>/bin/activate (Windows: <environment_name>\Scripts\activate).

3. # Install Django #:
 Inside the activated virtual environment, use pip install django to install Django using the pip package manager.

4. # Start a new Django project #:
 Navigate to your desired project directory and run django-admin startproject myapi. This creates the project structure with core Django files.

5. # Create a Django app #:
 Inside the myapp directory (you can rename this), run python manage.py startapp myapp. This creates a reusable app within your project.

6. # Configure the project #:
 Open myapi/settings.py and add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS list. This tells Django to recognize your app.

7. # Building the API #:

Define Models: In myapp/models.py, create models to represent your data. Models define the database structure for your API.

Create Views:  In myapp/views.py, write functions (views) that handle API requests (GET, POST, etc.) and return responses. These views interact with your models and process data.

Configure URLs: In myapp/urls.py, map URLs to your views. This tells Django which view to call based on the incoming request path.

8. # Run and Test # :

Start the development server: Navigate to your project directory and run python manage.py runserver. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to access the Django admin interface. Here, you can create and manage data for testing your API.
